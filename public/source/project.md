### Project 1 Learning Collaborative Graphs and Correlation Filters for Multimodal Object Tracking, NSFC 2017.1-2020.12
- Introduction

The goal of multimodal object tracking is to track target objects robustly in challenging scenes and environmental conditions by leveraging multiple different yet complementary visual data. It plays a critical role in wide range of applications, such as visual surveillance, self-driving systems and robotics, due to its potentials in handling variety of challenging factors (low illumination, smog, background clutter, etc.). Existing multimodal tracking methods usually localize the object with a bounding box, in which the foreground object trackers/detectors are often disturbed by the introduced background information. To handle this problem, this project aims to learn a collaborative graph with image patches as nodes for multimodal tracking, in which the weight of each node indicates how likely it belongs to the foreground and edges are also weighted for indicating the appearance compatibility of two neighboring nodes. The optimized node weights are then incorporated into the object representation to achieve robust tracking. In addition, we also study a collaborative correlation filter to overcome the dependency of multimodal alignment in conventional methods. The collaborative correlation filter takes the relations of object locations and motions in different modalities into account to track the object collaboratively.
