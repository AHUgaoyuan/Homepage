## Group Introduction
For large-scale multi-modal data such as text, image, and video (including visible light, near/thermal infrared, or depth data), we study the theoretical and practical research of visual computing and deep learning. Our research interests mainly are: (1) Multi-modal intelligent computing based on deep learning, including deep learning based intelligent fusion of different modalities, cross-modal matching and generation, and related problems and applications. (2) Intelligent video monitoring technology for public safety, including object detection, motion tracking, attribute recognition, and re-identification in a wide range of complex monitoring scenarios, and platform development of big data analysis.
